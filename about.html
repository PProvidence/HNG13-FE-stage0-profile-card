                <p class="section-text">
                    My journey into web development began with a simple curiosity about how websites work. What started as tinkering with HTML and CSS quickly evolved into a deep passion for creating beautiful, functional user experiences. I've always been drawn to the intersection of design and technology, where creativity meets problem-solving.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">
                    Over the years, I've honed my skills in frontend development, specializing in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React. I believe that great web development isn't just about writing codeâ€”it's about understanding users, anticipating their needs, and crafting experiences that feel intuitive and delightful.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">
                    Beyond technical skills, I bring a collaborative spirit to every project. I thrive in team environments where ideas are shared freely, and I'm always eager to learn from others while contributing my own insights and expertise.

                <p class="section-text">
                    While I'm confident in many areas of frontend development, I recognize that growth requires honesty about where I can improve. Here are the areas where I'm actively working to strengthen my skills:
                </p>
                <ul class="confidence-list">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Backend Development:</strong> While I have foundational knowledge, I'm still building confidence in areas like API design, authentication systems, and database optimization.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Advanced State Management:</strong> Complex state management patterns in large-scale applications, particularly with tools like Redux and Zustand, are areas I'm continuously learning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Testing Practices:</strong> While I understand the importance of unit and integration testing, I'm working to make testing a more natural part of my workflow and learn advanced testing strategies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>System Design:</strong> Thinking through scalable architecture and making strategic technical decisions for large applications is something I'm actively developing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>DevOps & CI/CD:</strong> While I can deploy applications, I want to deepen my understanding of containerization, deployment pipelines, and infrastructure management.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                        Hey future me! ðŸ‘‹
                    </p>
                    <p class="note-text">
                        Remember this momentâ€”the excitement, the nervousness, the determination. You're embarking on this journey because you believe in your potential and you're ready to grow.
                    </p>
                    <p class="note-text">
                        When things get challenging (and they will), remember why you started. Remember that every expert was once a beginner, and every mistake is a lesson in disguise. Don't compare your progress to othersâ€”focus on being better than you were yesterday.
                    </p>
                    <p class="note-text">
                        Celebrate your wins, no matter how small. Be kind to yourself when you struggle. Ask for help when you need it. And most importantly, never lose that curiosity and passion that brought you here.
                    </p>
                    <p class="note-text">
                        You've got this. Keep coding, keep learning, keep building. The person you're becoming is worth every challenge you'll face.

                <h2 class="section-title">Beyond the Code</h2>
                <p class="section-text">
                    When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, reading tech blogs and documentation, or contributing to open-source projects. I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning and staying current with industry trends.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">
                    I also value work-life balance. Swimming helps me clear my mind, music fuels my creativity, and reading broadens my perspective. I've learned that the best code often comes from a well-rested, balanced mind.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">
                    I'm excited about the future of web developmentâ€”the rise of new frameworks, improved accessibility standards, and the growing emphasis on user experience. I want to be part of building a more inclusive, performant, and beautiful web.
